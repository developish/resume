# My Resumé

Absurdly over-the-top generation of my resumé in PDF format from HTML source material.

## Why?

* Because it's fun
* I wanted to use the wicked_pdf gem
* wkhtmltopdf currently has a rendering problem on my Mac
* To use Vagrant and Ansible and to show off a little
* I like typing é

## How

On a Mac, with Vagrant and Virtualbox installed:

    $ vagrant up # this will take a long time
    $ open resumé.pdf
